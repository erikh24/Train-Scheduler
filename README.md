# Train-Scheduler

Project Title:
Train Scheduler

Prerequisites:
This is a website so there is no need to install any special software to view it.

Description:
Use the current train schedule to see when the train you need will be arriving next. Or add a train of your own to view it's upcoming arrival.

Problem Encountered:
The biggest problem that I encountered while creating this project was getting the 'Next Arrival' time and the 'Minutes Away' to calculate correctly. The first thing that I did when trying to work through this issue was I wrote out on paper what I was trying to do in just words, not code. I then took what I wrote and thought about how that would look with code and started trying to solve each step one at a time. I also spent a lot of time reviewing the documentation on the Moment.js site and thought about the best approach to use for trying to solve my issue.

Built With:
